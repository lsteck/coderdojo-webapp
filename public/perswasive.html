	If you think my sister can play the trombone well she can’t and hear are my reasons why 

		One reason is that her arms are too short. I think that because My friend Porter with long arms has trouble playing it. The other reason is her arms are shorter than his.
	
		Another reason is that it’s hard to play. You also have to remember so many positions it’ll be hard to remember them all. Az she seems more of a clarinet player than a trombone player.
		
		So and finally my final reason is that my mom and I are the musical people in our family. So I’d like to keep it that way and my final reason is in another sentence is. She is to FLAT!!!
		
		So did you like my persuasive writing and agere with me? If you did, then come and help me persuade her It’ll be fun. So come in over and start persuading today. :)
